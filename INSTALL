This file tries to explain how to set up QAntenna in 3 (or 4) steps.


1) Requirements
---------------
You have to install the Qt(*, the GL(** and the GLUT(** development files.
You can easily do this by entering the following command:

For debian based systems:
	apt-get install qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools


Fedora based systems:
	yum install qt4-devel		(TODO: update for qt5)

(** http://www.opengl.com/

For running QAntenna, you will need nec2++, available at

http://www.physics.otago.ac.nz/research/electronics/nec/index.html

QAntenna and nec2++ are available as Debian packages qantenna and necpp.


2) Compiling
------------
Now you should be ready to compile QAntenna. Enter the source directory and run
the following command to generate a Makefile:

	qtchooser -qt=5 -run-tool=qmake qantenna.pro

By default qantenna is installed under /usr/local. If you want to specify
another directory for example /opt you can do that by entering:

	qmake-qt4 PREFIX=/opt qantenna.pro
	qtchooser -qt=5 -run-tool=qmake qantenna.pro

Now the Makefile should created and you should be able to compile QAntenna by
the following command:

	make


3) Installation
---------------
Now you should be able to install QAntenna with the following command:

	make install

Please remember that you have to be superuser to do that (at least if you have
not specified a PREFIX where the current user has writepermission).
Finally we should be able to run QAntenna. You can test it by entering the
following command:

	/usr/local/bin/qantenna

If you have choosen a PREFIX replace /usr/local with it.

4) Troubleshooting
------------------
If you can't get QAntenna working also you tried out everything you could think
about, feel free to contact the QAntenna mailinglist:

	qantenna-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

For further information have a look at the README file.
