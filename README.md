# QAntenna: a multiplatform antenna and radiation pattern analyzer #

## Introduction and motivations ##

QAntenna is a multiplatform Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS), released
under the GPL. It's aim is to provide to the scientific community with a
program to view and analyze antennas and their radiation patterns.

The program was written originally to fulfil two objectives:
- create a libre software to allow students to have a tool to analyze antennas at no cost -
- to present it as a final work for the subject Principios de Computadoras II,
Electronic Engineering grade course at the Universidad Nacional del Sur,
Argentina.

Because at the university there's a variety of OSs running, the software is
designed to be multiplatform. As the original programmers were Linux and
KDE desktop users following a curse on OO programming, the idea to use
Trolltech's Qt 5 libraries were thought as the most appropiate for the project.

The program was first intended to be a direct replacement for Antennavis, written
in Tcl/Tk.

As Antennavis' source code wasn't written in an OO language, it was
decided to write QAntenna from scratch. The visualization would be created
using OpenGL, the standard for multiplatform visualization programs.
